              <p>
                Adoptrees is an online green gifting and environmental contribution platform where individuals and
                organizations can adopt, gift, or sponsor real trees. Our team undertakes the responsibility of planting,
                maintaining, and providing lifecycle updates of each tree.
              </p>
              <p>
                By using our platform, you acknowledge that your tree adoption is a symbolic act of environmental
                contribution and not an ownership of land, forest, or timber.
